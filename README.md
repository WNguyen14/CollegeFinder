# CollegeFinder
  CollegeFinder is a opensource website designed to help students and parents prepare for a college career.
  
# Challenge Statement
  Due to greater access to online resources and education, students need ways to learn about all of the different academic programs and institutions that will best fit their needs. This service will attempt to accomplish that goal of informing users of some ideal options to look at when making the next move for their education. 

# Team Vision
  For students and parents investing in their academic future, the College Finder is a website that provides resources and guidance that helps to point users toward institutions and programs that fit their skills, needs, interests, and financial situations. Unlike other tools to provide resources for prospective students looking into higher education, our product strives to provide accurate information without bias. 
  
# For Contributors
  Hey! I'm Alex, one of the students responsible for this project, currently this project is under development as an academic project, so updates and PR's from outside sources aren't currently being accepted. In the future this project may be released to the public so anyone can contribute, but for now things will remain as they are for the sake of âœ¨academic honestyâœ¨. If you happened to come across our page during this time, welcome to the party! Feel free to take a look around and see if this is something you'd be interested in. Otherwise thanks for stopping by and taking the time to read this! ðŸ˜„
